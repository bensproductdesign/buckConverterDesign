# buckConverterDesign
Design of a buck converter with specs: Vin : 12V Vout: 5V Iout = 5A

Use case: 
- This buck converter is to be used to power an LED light strip. Later revisions will include different currents and voltages. 

Steps Involved in Designing a Buck Converter: 
1. Chip selection / circuit schematic determination.
2. Component sizing 
3. Component sourcing 
4. PCB Layout 
5. Assembly
6. Testing


Steps Involved in managing a design project: 
1. Generate user requirements document 
2. Generate technical requirements document
3. Create work breakdown structure
4. Create Gantt chart 
5. Identify risks/ delays/ bottlenecks
